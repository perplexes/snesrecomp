"""snesrecomp.tools.v2_regen

Drive the v2 pipeline over every bank cfg in a SMW-style repo,
producing one C file per bank into the single active generated-code
directory.

Usage:
    python snesrecomp/tools/v2_regen.py --rom smw.sfc \
        --cfg-dir SuperMarioWorldRecomp/recomp \
        --out-dir SuperMarioWorldRecomp/src/gen

For each `bankXX.cfg` under --cfg-dir:
    1. parse via cfg_loader.load_bank_cfg
    2. emit via emit_bank.emit_bank
    3. write to <out_dir>/smw_XX_v2.c

Exits 0 if every bank completed; non-zero otherwise. Per-bank failures
are caught and reported individually so a single bug doesn't block
the rest of the integration run.

    The initial variant-discovery pass can see calls *to* synthetic

    The same refresh is also needed after exit-(M, X) autorouting learns
    that a callee returns with different status widths. A call site after
    such a JSR/JSL may demand a different target variant than the
    pre-autoroute decode discovered. If that target variant is missing,
    later valid-variant maps can suppress a live runtime mode and the
    generated switch falls through to its default no-op case.

    # function's exit (m, x) state. Used by decoder._labeled_successors
    # to set the resume (m, x) after JSR/JSL, instead of assuming the
    # callee preserves m/x. Required when the callee internally does
    # SEP/REP without restoring before its RTS — e.g. SMW $00:F465
    # starts with SEP #$20 (m=1) and never resets, so callers in m=0
    # would otherwise misdecode operand widths after the JSR.

    # Earlier version (2026-05-03 morning) tried an automatic fixpoint
    # over EVERY decoded (addr, m, x) variant. Worked for the slope-
    # bug case but introduced regressions elsewhere (GraphicsDecompress
    # entered an infinite loop) — the analyzer's exit-(m,x) inference
    # was apparently wrong for some functions where intermediate
    # callee_exit_mx values during the fixpoint produced unreachable-
    # path artefacts that biased the analyzer. Reverted to opt-in until
    # we have a more principled inference (e.g. CFG-aware path
