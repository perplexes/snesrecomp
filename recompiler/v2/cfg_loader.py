"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.cfg_loader

Parse a v1-format bank cfg file into a v2 `BankCfg` dataclass that
`emit_bank` can consume.

v2 IGNORES the v1 ABI-fiction directives:
- `sig:` — every v2 function is `void f(CpuState *cpu)`.
- `ret_y` / `carry_ret` — return value is never materialised; flags
  and registers live in the CpuState struct.
- `y_after:` / `x_after:` — call-site index increments are dead with
  the new ABI (caller and callee both see cpu->X / cpu->Y).
- `restores_x:` / DP-aliased struct params (e.g. `CollInfo_*ci`) —
  same, dead.

v2 KEEPS:
- `bank = NN`
- `includes = ...` (used to extend the default emit_bank header).
- `func <name> <hex_pc> [end:<hex_end>]` — the entry list. Anything
  on the line after the address is parsed for `end:` and otherwise
  discarded.
- `name <hex_addr> <name>` — friendly-naming for cross-bank labels.
  v2 emits these as `void NAME(CpuState *cpu);` forward declarations
  in funcs.h (Phase 6e/f). For now we just retain them.
- `exclude_range <start> <end>` — data region carved out of decode.
- `data_region <bank> <start> <end>` — same idea, cross-bank.
