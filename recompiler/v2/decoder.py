"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.decoder

Worklist-driven 65816 decoder keyed by (PC, M, X) entry state.

REPLACES THE V1 DECODE BUG: v1's `decode_func` (recomp.py:52-354) tracks
M/X as linear scalars and stores branch-target mode hints in
`pending_flags: Dict[PC, (m, x)]` with explicit last-writer-wins overwrite
(recomp.py:298-300 comment makes this explicit). When two predecessors
reach the same PC with different (m, x), one is silently dropped and that
PC ends up decoded with the wrong mode — which is invalid for 65816
because variable-length immediate operands (LDA #imm in M=1 vs M=0) are
2 bytes vs 3 bytes, so the dropped mode can corrupt every subsequent
instruction's PC offset.

In v2, every instruction is identified by `DecodeKey(pc, m, x)`. Two
predecessors with different mode states produce two distinct
DecodedInsn records at the same PC — both are preserved. Downstream
(v2 cfg / IR / codegen) treats them as two separate blocks.

The opcode table in `snes65816.py` and the per-instruction
`decode_insn(rom, off, pc, bank, m, x)` helper are reused as-is — they
already correctly compute variable-length immediates *given* an (m, x)
input. The bug was always in the v1 caller, not in `decode_insn`.
