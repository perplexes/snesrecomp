"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.decoder

Worklist-driven 65816 decoder keyed by (PC, M, X) entry state.

REPLACES THE V1 DECODE BUG: v1's `decode_func` (recomp.py:52-354) tracks
M/X as linear scalars and stores branch-target mode hints in
`pending_flags: Dict[PC, (m, x)]` with explicit last-writer-wins overwrite
(recomp.py:298-300 comment makes this explicit). When two predecessors
reach the same PC with different (m, x), one is silently dropped and that
PC ends up decoded with the wrong mode — which is invalid for 65816
because variable-length immediate operands (LDA #imm in M=1 vs M=0) are
2 bytes vs 3 bytes, so the dropped mode can corrupt every subsequent
instruction's PC offset.

In v2, every instruction is identified by `DecodeKey(pc, m, x)`. Two
predecessors with different mode states produce two distinct
DecodedInsn records at the same PC — both are preserved. Downstream
(v2 cfg / IR / codegen) treats them as two separate blocks.

The opcode table in `snes65816.py` and the per-instruction
`decode_insn(rom, off, pc, bank, m, x)` helper are reused as-is — they
already correctly compute variable-length immediates *given* an (m, x)
input. The bug was always in the v1 caller, not in `decode_insn`.

    Worklist over DecodeKey tuples. Each key is decoded at most once;
    same PC with divergent (m, x) produces multiple keys → multiple
    DecodedInsn records.

    `dispatch_helpers`: optional map of {target_addr_24 -> 'short'|'long'}.
    When a JSL/JML hits a target in this map, the bytes immediately AFTER
    the JSL are decoded as a function-pointer TABLE (not as instructions).
    Each table entry is recorded as a successor key (so the dispatched
    handlers get decoded too) and the ORIGINAL JSL is marked with
    `insn.dispatch_entries` for downstream codegen. Decode resumes
    AFTER the table (not at the JSL+length offset). Without this hook,
    SMW's "JSL Foo; .dw target0, target1, ..." pattern at $00:9325 would
    decode the TABLE BYTES as garbage instructions.

    `indirect_call_tables`: optional map of {site_pc24 -> dict} where
    each value is `{'base': int, 'count': int, 'kind': 'short'|'long'}`.
    Authorises a JSR (abs,X) site as a real indirect dispatch. When
    set, the decoder reads `count` table entries at `bank:base`,
    stamps `insn.dispatch_entries`, and adds the entries as decode
    successors so handlers get decoded too. Without an entry, JSR
    (abs,X) is treated as cfg-unauthorised: the insn is placed in the
    graph with no successors (severing fall-through) and recorded in
    graph.suppressed_indirect_calls for the build report. See the

    Walks every terminator in `graph` and takes the meet of the (m, x)
    state at which control leaves the function:

      - RTS/RTL/RTI: don't modify M/X, so each terminator's
        `(insn.m_flag, insn.x_flag)` IS the (m, x) at the moment of
        return.

      - JSL/JML dispatch terminator (`insn.dispatch_entries` populated
        and no fall-through successors): the dispatcher transfers
        control to a handler which RTLs back to OUR caller. The
        effective exit state at this terminator is whichever (m, x)
        the dispatched handler RTLs with. Requires `callee_exit_mx`
        to have an entry for each table target keyed by the dispatch
        site's (m, x); if any handler's exit is unknown we return
        `(None, None)` (retry on a later auto-router pass once more
        callees converge).

        Soundness note: the JSL dispatch helper itself runs in a
        canonical state (e.g. SMW's `$00:86FA` runs with the
        dispatcher's `(m, x)` and forwards without restoring P), so
        the handler is entered with the dispatch SITE's (m, x). Each
        handler's `callee_exit_mx[(target, site_m, site_x)]` IS the
        handler's RTL (m, x), which becomes our function's effective
        exit.

    If all return paths exit with the same (m, x), returns that pair.
    If any two return paths disagree, the corresponding component is
    `None` (ambiguous — the caller's decoder should fall back to its
    pre-call assumption rather than commit to a wrong width).

    Functions with no terminators (e.g. infinite loops, table-only)
