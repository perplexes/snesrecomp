"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.emit_function

Per-function v2 emit driver: decode_function → build_cfg → IR lowering
→ codegen → C function source.

Replaces v1's `emit_function()` (recomp.py:5930+, ~2200 lines including
EmitCtx state plumbing + heuristic phi machinery). The v2 driver is
explicit and stateless: each block is lowered independently, and
control flow between blocks is wired via labels + gotos based on the
v2 CFG edges.

Public API:
    emit_function(rom, bank, start, entry_m, entry_x, *, end=None,
                  func_name=None) -> str

Returns a complete `void <func_name>(CpuState *cpu) { ... }` C source
string.

    #       (no further stack manipulation in successor) — multi-block
    #       BNE NLRBlock; NLRBlock: PLA*N + BRA tail; tail: work + RTS.
