# snesrecomp

A static recompiler for SNES (Super Famicom) games. Translates 65816
machine code into native C ahead-of-time, so the recompiled game runs
as a normal binary rather than under interpretation.

> ## Status: alpha (v0.1.0), three games at varying playability
>
> **Super Mario World is believed fully playable** through the
> recompiler. **Mega Man X is believed fully playable** end-to-end.
> **A Link to the Past** is playable through the early dungeon. The
> framework itself is still alpha: APIs change without warning and
> internal docs assume active-session context.
> [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp/releases/tag/v0.1.0) is
> the first tagged release — a working snapshot that all three games
> build against, not a stability guarantee.

## Per-game runner repos

snesrecomp is the shared framework. Each game lives in its own
companion repo that junctions this checkout as a sibling and supplies
the game-specific runtime, `.cfg`, and build glue.

- **Super Mario World** —
  [mstan/SuperMarioWorldRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/SuperMarioWorldRecomp).
  **Believed playable end-to-end.** Hand-verified from Yoshi's Island
  through the Forest of Illusion and into Star Road (the secret world
  hub); later/special content beyond that not yet hand-verified but
  expected to play similarly. Two always-on runtime tripwires (M/X claim
  verifier and async cpu->m_flag/x_flag-write detector) have not latched
  on the verified worlds.

- **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past** —
  [mstan/ZeldaAlttPSNESRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/ZeldaAlttPSNESRecomp).
  **Playable through early dungeon.** Boot → attract demo → file
  select → overworld → Module 07 (Dungeon) with sword combat is
  hand-verified. Later content not yet hand-verified.

- **Mega Man X** —
  [mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp).
  **Believed playable end-to-end.** Boot → Capcom logo → attract intro
  → title screen → intro stage and the Maverick stages with their
  bosses play through; the earlier lockups (cooperative-scheduler
  stalls, dispatch-site m/x mistranslations) and visual rough edges
  have been resolved.

The intent is for snesrecomp to be **game-agnostic** — adding a new
game should cost mostly per-game `.cfg` work, not months of framework
patching. SMW exercised the framework hard during 2026-04/05 and
surfaced the bug classes the framework now handles permanently:
per-variant exit-(M, X) inference with order-independent fixpoint,
dispatch-terminator JSL recognition, PHP/PLP-bracketed M/X tracking,
wrapper-bypass autorouter, tail-call autorouter, and a full runtime
tripwire suite catalogued in [`docs/TRIPWIRES.md`](docs/TRIPWIRES.md).
LttP and MMX have each surfaced their own framework gaps (LoROM
bank-mirror routing, MMX cooperative-scheduler HLE, abs-indirect
dispatch emit, dispatch-site m/x tracking) that are now baked in.

## What's in this repo

- `recompiler/` — Python code that decodes 65816 ROM bytes,
  reconstructs control flow, and emits C.
- `runner/` — C runtime that the generated code links against (CPU
  state, memory mapping, debug server, always-on trace rings).
- `tests/` — framework tests (decoder, CFG, SSA placement, etc.) and
  L3 fixtures.
- `fuzz/` — differential fuzzer over synthetic 65816 snippets.
- `tools/` — scripts for regen, trace diffing, etc., plus
  [`tools/mmxref/`](tools/mmxref/): a standalone SDL2 libretro frontend
  that serves as the hardware-accurate timing/state reference for
  diffing the recompiled build.

## Public API / docs

There isn't a public API yet, and there aren't user-facing docs.
Internal docs assume context from active development sessions and
will not make sense without it. This will change once the framework
stabilizes.

## License

Not yet declared. Code in this repo is original, except the libretro
API header `tools/mmxref/libretro.h`, which is MIT (RetroArch team).
The reference tool (`tools/mmxref/`) loads a libretro emulator core as
a runtime DLL — no emulator source or binary is vendored in this repo,
so it carries none of a core's licensing terms; supply a core yourself.
